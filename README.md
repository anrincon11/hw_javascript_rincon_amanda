# JavaScript Homework

This homework definitely helped me understand JavaScript a lot more. There's something about hands-on application that really makes things click for me.

## Resources

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) was used to help me better understand function expressions. This website provided a syntax, parameter explanations, a description, and examples of function expressions to show how they work.
* [Helephant.com](http://helephant.com/2012/07/14/javascript-function-declaration-vs-expression/) was another website used to help me understand the differences between function declarations and function expressions. It provided examples and explanations for both.
* [JavaScript.info](http://javascript.info/tutorial/arguments) was used to help me better understand function arguments. Many different examples were provided.
* Other than what is mentioned above, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Comments

I really liked how everything in this assignment gave us practice on what we were taught in lecture. I also like how this assignment challenged me enough to get practice with pull requests and learn how they work.
